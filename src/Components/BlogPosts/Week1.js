                            <p>The first week of onboarding is now drawing to a close. This bootcamp may be one of the most challenging
                            things I have ever done, and I can't wait! I was certainly nervous getting started, as I hadn't the faintest
                            idea about coding. But now at the close of week one I am much more confident that I am exactly where I am
                            supposed to be. My particular style of learning has always been hands on, and this is how the bootcamp is set up.
                            In the first week we have already dove deep into Github and Codeanywhere. I am not ashamed to say that the two
                            really kicked my butt, but I am also proud to say that by the end of the week I am **WAY** more confident with both!
                            I'm hopeful that I will continue to grasp the concepts that are constantly getting thrown at me.
                            I can't wait to see what we learn next!</p>

                            <p> I will continue to add to this page frequently so be on the lookout for more content ahead!</p>
