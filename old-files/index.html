            <p>Week 2 of Coding Bootcamp has gone by very quick. While week one laid the foudation for what we would be doing for the rest of the Bootcamp, it was small potatoes to what we would learn this week. From the get go we had a ton of information thrown at us. We dove right into HTML, CSS, and the Chrome Dev Tools.</p>
            
            <p>It was only the second week and it felt like we were in "It." We were finally learning to really code. This wasn't a week were we would have a bunch of quizes and busy work, no we were right in the middle of it! After a week of so much real coding, it made me realize that choosing the Bootcamp over taking four years of courses at a university was the right decision. There is no fluff or filler, it's all practical and useable.</p>
            
            <p>While this second week was fun, there were also many struggles and challenges for me personally. There was a whole lot of informatino thrown at us and I found myself having difficulty to stay focused and retain the knowledge. However, I was able to get through it and start using that knowledge right away. I always find that I learn best by getting my hands dirty right away, and once again this was no exception. I found that another hurdle for me to overcome this week was just how often I let spelling and syntax errors get by without me noticing. After hours of trying to figure out why my code didn't seem to want to work, I stepped away for awhile and came back. Wouldn't you know it but it all came down to a few key spelling error to completely stonewall me. I have come to the conclusion that while being in the zone and inputing large chunks of a project are good, it's best for me personally to go in small chunks and go back and check before I've input so much that double checking becomes difficut.</p>
