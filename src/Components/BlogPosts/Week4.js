                            for an entire month! Every week has presented a new challenge and every week now we have all
                            been able to conquer those challenges! I'm very excited that this next week will begin the 
                            in person portion of the Bootcamp. It will be good to interact with my fellow bootcampers, hear
                            their struggles and triumphs, and bounce ideas off of each other.</p>

                            This past week was a lot of <i>pseudocod</i>, and I must say that I trully struggled with it.
                            While I have experience writing and outlining in the past, I really find it difficult to get my
                            thoughts and ideas down on a page. I understand the need for it, but the implementation of it 
                            will be something I will struggle with for now.
                        </p>
                        <p>The more time that passes though, the more I believe that I made the right choice in coming here.
                            If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth doing. It will be nice to be in person though as I find remote
                            learning to not be the easiest.
                        </p>
