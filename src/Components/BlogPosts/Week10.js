                            was difficult but once again we all came out on top. I will say I have never felt such and up and
                                down in my confidence as I have through the weeks of this Bootcamp.</p>

                            <p>This week we were introduced to <i>React Hooks</i> as a bit of an introduction to the Backend. This was also
                            the first week were we weren't all given the same project ot complete. We had three paths from which to choose, and
                            I chose the path of making the products page and shopping cart for a fake fishing website. It was certainly interesting
                            to see the innerworkings of something like that. What was even more interesting was seeing all the different projects.
                            It was also interesting to see what concepts drew the attention of my fellow bootcampers. A few went the same route as I,
                            while others chose the route of setting up the login site and credentials, or the checkout methods. In the end through
                            I have to admit that I did not take to React as quickly as I had anticipated. It was a real dissapointment for me personally
                            as I felt a real connection with the structure and rules of it. This next week we will be starting Backend Development and
                            we have been told it's kind of like a clean slate restart. I look forward to that.</p>

                            <p>Once again it really felt like a week where we all came togehter as classmates. We all realized this time period was
                            the first time that we had all learned a new language together, in person. It really seemed like all of us struggling
                            together was the glue that we all needed! I can't wait to see what this next week has in store for us.
