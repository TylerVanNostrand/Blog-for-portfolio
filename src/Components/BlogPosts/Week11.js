                                This week was the dive into the Backend with <i>PHP</i>. It was a restart for all of us and I was desperately
                                needed I feel.</p>

                            <p>The project this week was a mix of PHP and MySQL and it was really nice to see how much our cohort pulled together
                            this week. Once one of us learned something, they shared it with the group, and then the group benefited. It really
                            became more of us depending on each other instead of just depending on our instructors. This was also the first week
                            that we all gave thought to what we are going to do after this is all over. What kind of jobs are out there for us?
                            Are we marketable? Will we be able to find a job that can support our families or lifestyles? It's a whole new level
                            of  stress, but its also a light at the end of the tunnel.
                            </p>

                            <p>This coming week we will be getting more in depth into PHP and also adding Laravel to the mix. I will say I have enjoyed
                            learning the Backend of Development. I wonder if it will be something I continue to enjoy as time goes on.
                            </p>
