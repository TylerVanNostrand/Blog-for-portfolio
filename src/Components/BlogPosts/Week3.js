                         <p class="card-text">Well this was a fun week! Lots of learning of <i>Dev Tools</i> and <i>JavaScript</i> 
                            while also implementing initial concepts of <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i>. It was interesting to see how 
                            all three are interwoven together. </p>

                        <p>This week's project was building an Alarm Clock. We had to use <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>JavaScript</i> all together in order
                            bring a working project to the table. This week went well for me and things seemed to come together much more quickly. I was able
                            to bring a working demo to the table that met all the requirements and wow did that feel good! I will say that a take away for me 
                            was that when things aren't going well it's ok to walk away for a few minutes. I don't have to be tethered to the computer to fix
                            a problem. Some times you have to come back and look at it with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

                        <p>Next week is <i>pseudocode</i>.  I can forsee me struggling with this though as I know I have problems getting my thoughts translated
                            to words sometimes. However, I certainly see how useful <i>pseudocode</i> is in order to have an outline of what you want to accomplish.
