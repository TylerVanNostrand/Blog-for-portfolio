                            This was the first week of in person classes. It was great to be able to interact with my
                            fellow classmates in person. One thing that plagued me through out the onboarding/remote
                            process, was the feeling that I wasn't where I should be developmentaly. However, listening
                            the struggles of my fellow classmates, and hearing their own progress reports, really put things
                            into a new light for me. They all struggle just like I do. It's a sentament that really brings
                            a group together.</p>

                            I will say this Bootcamp has made me learn how to learn again. Every week is a lesson on time
                           management and how to study and learn. This week we went over <i>Bootstrap</i> and <i>Atomic Design</i>.
                           Having had some small background in Marketing and Advertisement, I felt right at home with them.
                           It's so interesting to see how each week seems to stack the concepts from the previous week on top
                           of one another.

                            This week we were challenged by Dr. Luke, as to what our "Why" is for doing this bootcamp. It will be
                            a question that I will need to keep in the forefront of my mind as time goes on and the bootcamp becomes
                            more and more difficult.</p>
