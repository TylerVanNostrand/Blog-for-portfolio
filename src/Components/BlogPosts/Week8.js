                            Two months ago, if you put a line of code in front of me I wouldn't know the top from the bottom. Now I can confidently say
                            that I could possibly know what was going on inside that code. It blows my mind! I have come from a background with almost
                                now computer experience to making a weather app, a tic-tac-toe game, or like this week, a menu for a restaurnt that uses an API. </p>

                            <p>This week we had our into into <i>React</i> and there was so much information thrown at us, that my eyes hurt thinking about it.
                                I see how useful this is for simplifying JavaScript. I will say I struggled just to digest the amount of information thrown at
                                us this week. Once again, time management skills come into play with what we do on the daily here at the Bootcamp. </p>

                            <p>One thing that I found myself really utilizing this week was the ChromeDevTools function. I had massive errors that if I didn't
                            have those at my disposal I would have never made it through the week. I'm hopful that React becomes something I understand well
                            as the rules behind it really speak to me on a personal level.
