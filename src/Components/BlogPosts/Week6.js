                            for a few days and get tested. I will say that this week felt like a step backwards for me. Switching from in person back to
                            remote, even for just a few days, was really difficult for me. However, this is the reality we are all living in these days.
                                We're all just glad that no one else tested positive and that the individual seems to already be feeling better!</p>

                            imposter syndrome has hit me hard this week, but getting back together with my classmates is sure to help with that.
