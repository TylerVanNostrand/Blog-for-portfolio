                            <p class="card-text">This was our last week using Vanilla Javascript. We had to create our own Tic-Tac-Toe game.
                            I should have known ,when the project was introduced to us earlier than normal, that this week was not going
                                to be easy. And it was not, but once again I was able to come to Demo Day with a working project!  </p>

                            <p>This week the big take away was learning <i>MVC</i>. The whole Model, View, Controller method was interesting,
                                and I'm not ashamed to admit, difficult for me to wrap my head around. I feel like the more I use this method
                                the easier it will be to understand how it works.</p>

                            <p>This week I still find myself struggling with Pseudocode and being able to get my thoughts out on a page coherently.
                            Ultimately I reazlize how important this skill is to have, but it has been difficult for me to master. Being able to
                            walk your way through the code beforehand is so useful. This will be something I will have to work hard on.
                            </p>
