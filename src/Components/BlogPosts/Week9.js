                            bye and the amount of progress we are all making is great. It really feels like the whole class is growing
                                closer together.</p>

                            <p> Another week of React had me pulling my hair out, only to complete the project a full day earlier than what
                            I usually do! This week we worked on making a To-Do List. While I was able to finish the project earlier
                            than what I thought I was going to be able too, it was still a struggle to use React correctly.
                            I really thought React was going to be "my thing", but it has proven to be difficult for me. Another week
                                were imposter syndrome has hit hard.</p>

                            <p>Next week we will be diving deeper into React and I am excited with a healthy dose of trepidation. This week
                            I bit the bullet and asked for extra help outside of the Bootcamp. My instructors were more than happy to
                            lend a hand, and give me a lot of extra resources. I must say I have really appreciated them being available
                                to us.</p>
