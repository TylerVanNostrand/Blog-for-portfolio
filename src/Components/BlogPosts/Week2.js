                        <p class="card-text">The second week of the remote onboarding is finished! And wow have I been
                        introduced to a ton of content. <i>HTML</i> , <i>CSS</i> , and <i>Google Dev Tools</i> were the topics
                        of the week. I understand that these are core tools and I hope to grasp them quickly.</p>

                        <p>Learning <i>Git</i>  has been a challenge this week. I am understanding what commands
                        work, but I get frustrated when I don't learn them quickly. I found the best way for me is to just
                        do them over and over again until it becomes muscle memory! </p>

                        <p>I cetainly realize that I will run into these type of issues as this camp goes on. I have always
                        wanted to figure things out on my own and not ask for help. However, it was become evident that this
                        will not be the case. My instructors are phenominal! They're always willing and available to help and
                        I can see that all they want is for each of us to succeed. I still know it will be a challenge for me
                        to be willing and able to ask for help when I need it,  but knowing that they are there makes it much
                        easier.</p>

                        <p>In the coming week we will be learning <i>JavaScript</i>. The final piece of the puzzle for the
                        Onboarding Phase. I'm almost starting to feel like a real programmer. I'm excited that September
                        is here and the in-person portion of the Bootcamp is about to start. I feel like in-person learning
                        is really going to elevate my game! It was also be good to hangout with me classmates instead of only
                        interacting with them on Zoom.</p>
